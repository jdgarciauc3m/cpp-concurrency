\chapter*{Foreword}

Welcome!

In the multi-core era multi-threaded programming has transitioned
from being a topic for a relatively small set of expert developers
to be used more and more by the average programmer.
Since C++11, concurrency is not any more a platform specific issue,
but it is part of the standard language and library.

This is not a book. It is just the support material for a course on how you can
make use of concurrent programming in modern C++. 
Note that this course assumes that you
already have enough background on the C++ programming language.

I hope you find this course useful to improve your skills as a software
engineer allowing you to write better software.
