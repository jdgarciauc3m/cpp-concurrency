\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all, I would like to thank Bjarne Stroustrup for giving us 
the C++ programming language.

I also would like to express my gratitude to all members of the ISO/IEC
JTC1/SC22/WG21 that have worked over time to improve and update the language.
Special thanks to all the active and past members of the SG21 (concurrency
study group).
Discussing specific issues with many of them over the years has been extremely
helpful to me. 

I would like to specially thank everyone who provided feedback 
on previous versions of this material. 
%Obviously this list is permanently a work in progress list.
